1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
  - This is necessary inorder to make use of methods provided by the React Library;

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js. what would show up?
  - Displays an object

3.What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```

  - The elements are not nested into one single element (siblings cannot be rendered properly, it needs a parent element to house those siblings)


4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
  - Declarative = Give instruction on what to do without worrying too much on the exact steps on how to do it.
  - Imperative = Give instruction including detailed step by step process in achieving a task.

5. What does it mean for something to be composable?
  - Object that can be broken down into reusable parts.
