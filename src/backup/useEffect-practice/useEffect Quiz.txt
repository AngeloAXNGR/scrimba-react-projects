1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?
   - Any code that affects an outside system.
   - Code logic with functionalities that React is not responsible of 
   (api calls, localStorage, syncing two states)


2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?
   - Anything thing React in charge of
   - e.g Props, maintaining states for each render, rendering DOM etc..


3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
   - As soon as the component loads (first render)
   - On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
   - Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
   array stay the same between renders
   


4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is?
   - Array of values that serves as a basis on whether certain code should rerun or not
     when using useEffect.
