1. What is "conditional rendering"?
  - Conditional rendering is when as well as how a certain component should be shown
    based on a condition.


2. When would you use &&?
  - If you simply want to show or hide a component based on a truthy value



3. When would you use a ternary?
  - Show a component is viewed based on multiple possible condition



4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
  - Both && and ternary could work but using ternary might make the code
    less vebose.
