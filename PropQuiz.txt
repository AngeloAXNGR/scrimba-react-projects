1. What do props help us accomplish?
  - Helps load dynamic content to a component, it also eliminates hardcoded values
    which leads to duplicating of components if you want to display different content
    but still using the same component


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
  - <CustomeComponent title="???"/>



3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
  - No because its within the spec of HTML to have props


4. How do I receive props in a component?
  - explicitly stating the name of the prop followed by a value (e.g {props.name})
function Navbar(props) {
    return (
        <header>
            <h1>Hello my name is {props.name}</h1>
        </header>
    )
}


5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?
  - Object datatype.
